# Extreme Startup

This is my first version of the extreme startup game 
(see master [branch](https://github.com/epayet/extreme-startup-starter-kit) for description).

## How did it go

It is my first version of it in Node. Yeah it's not great. 
I was pairing with someone, and we spent a lot of time setting up the API more than answering questions.
I kept it as it is so I could learn from it, and be more prepared next time.

For a better version of this, see the master branch.

## What do I take from this?

We should have paired more. 
One could focus on making the API resilient, and the other one on the questions themselves.

We lost a lot of points in the beginning because of 500 errors.
